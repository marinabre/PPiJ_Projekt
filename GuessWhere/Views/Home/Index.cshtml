        Guess Where is an educational game which should make your geographical knowledge a bit better.
        The game features natural monuments like national parks of different countries around the world or
        national heritage sites that everyone should know about. Most importantly, while playing you learn!
        Each task gives you a picture, if you're willing to spend some of those coins that
        you got when you started the game, you can even use up a hint to refresh your memory.
        After each round, a green pin with the proper loaction appears and the description for the task you were given to locate.
